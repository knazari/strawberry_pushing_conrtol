Instruction to bring up the haptic fingerL

1. Connect the micro-usb to the port close to HTMI port (the one in the middle)
2. In the wired connection setting of the sensor, set IPV6 to "Disable" and the IPV4 to "Linnk-Local".
3. In the terminal ssh to the raspberrypi : -> ssh pi@raspberrypi.local       (password:  2880)
4. In the pi terminal run vncserver:  -> vncserver
5. Run roscore
6. Open VNC viewer. Connect to the ip address given in raspberrypi ssh window. remember to add :1 at the end of the ip address.
7. Correct the ip address in server.py and client.py. The ip adress is taken by  ->  hostname -I
8. Run server.py first and then run cient.py in the raspberrypi window.
9. Everything should be working alright now and you can check by rostopic echo that if the sensor image is being published properly.


Troubleshoot:
- If you cannot ssh (or cannot ping raspberrypi.local), sometime a restart or reconnecting the sensor will solve the prblem.
- If the VNC Viewer window does not show anything after connecting, you probably did not include the :1 in the ip address. Or the server.py is not running.
